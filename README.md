# About-me-
I am a Systems Engineer from the Pontifical Javeriana University. During the last years I have focused on the academic and work environment, developing my skills and my knowledge in different branches of engineering. I consider myself a passionate and motivated person to achieve what is proposed, I am mostly self-taught, curious, restless about new technologies, and the tools available today. I am not satisfied with the basics, I always seek to exceed expectations and give my best in any aspect. I am quite a social person, it is easy for me to work in a team, always taking the initiative and taking all opinions and ideas into account.
I have extensive knowledge in software development in different programming languages, using the best programming tools and practices. I have extensive knowledge in project development and software architecture, leaning more than anything towards agile methodologies.
I have general knowledge of administration and network topologies, in relational databases, information systems, artificial intelligence and development of mobile and web applications.
I want to establish myself, consolidate myself and be part of a company that allows me to put my knowledge into practice and that gives me the opportunity to achieve my goals and grow professionally, personally and intellectually.
